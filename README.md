# Random-Ego

Project that I'm building to automatically get the comments and replies of all the news on the website [EGO](http://ego.globo.com/). Ego is one of the most popular websites for reading news about celebrities and their lives, and it is well known because most of the news comments are terrible.

This project is in early-alpha and not ready for anything you may want to use it.

## Running

To hack on the code, clone the repository and then run

  npm start
